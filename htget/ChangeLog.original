0.95    First release

0.96	Add reference to RFC1945. Correct some resource URLs.

	Note that HTTP/0.9 servers not handled.

	Bound sock_getline loop by buffer length.

	Print warning if actual length != content length.

	Return non-zero status if failed to fetch document.

	Identify user agent as HTGET-DOS to avoid confusion with
	other HTGET.

0.97	Add -v flag to print some progress messages.

	Add -p ident:password to allow authorisation to be sent.

0.98	Add -o filename option to save to a file.

	Add -m to send If-Modified-Since with date of file in -o.

	Use getopt instead of doing argument parsing oneself.

0.99	Provide a manual page.

	Bug fix: if no Content-Length line, read until EOF

	Disable -m if -h specified. It will be ignored by the server
	anyway.

	Warn if continuation line seen. Fortunately the only header
	line we are interested in, Content-Length, is very unlikely
	to span lines.

1.00	If 301 or 302 response, print the Location line.

	Accept HTTP/1.1 resposes too.

	Link with latest version of Wattcp library to get fixes.
	Probably have no effect on this program but anyway...

	Final version.

1.01	Merged contributed code by Yury Semenov <yury@petre.odessa.ua>
	to go through a proxy.
	Set environment variable HTTP_PROXY to host:port of proxy.

1.02	Jeff Patterson suggested a running count of bytes fetched for
	long transfers.
